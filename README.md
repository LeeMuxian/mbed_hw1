##  (1) how to setup and run your program
Calculate all the means in the sequence the question asking for.
In each calculation, eliminate the value '-99.000' and '-999.000', and then compute the mean.
If there is no datum or there are only data of value '-99.000' or '-999.000' in the title we are now computing the mean of, then it will output 'None'.
##  (2) what are the results
[['C0A880', 1013.5], ['C0F9A0', 966.7], ['C0G640', 1015.9], ['C0R190', 1010.4], ['C0X260', 1011.0]]
